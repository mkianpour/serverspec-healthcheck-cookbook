# serverspec-healthcheck Cookbook

Idea is to prepare a machine which is smart enough to check its own health and report it back as a web page.

Specifically, it would be helpful for load balancers. As Load Balancers check health of system and stop sending traffic if it's not healthy. This health check is usually done using a URL. The generated health check page can be used for this URL then. If self-check fails, it will return a 3xx status code, otherwise 200 status code.

Self health check can also be useful in continuous delivery and if check fails after deploy, deployer will be notified right away instead of asking the developer.

To achieve this goal, 'Serverspec' is being used. So, Serverspec will be installed on the instance. 'spec' files go to 'files' directory and healthcheck page will be generated based on it.
